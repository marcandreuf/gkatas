"""
Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the fist linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of second linked list, then they are intersecting.

list1: 3,1,5,9
                7,2,1   7 is intersection node
list2:  ,2,4,6

Testing. Create list3 7,2,1
Add method to LinkedList to join the list at the end.
Create list1 and list2
Join list1 to list3
Join list2 to list3
Test intersection
Implement intersection function
